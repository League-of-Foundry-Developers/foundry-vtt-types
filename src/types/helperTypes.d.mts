/**
 * `Partial` is usually the wrong type.
 * In order to make it easier to audit unintentional uses of `Partial` this type is provided.
 *
 * ### Picking the right helper type
 * - Favor `NullishProps` whenever it is valid. Allowing both `null` and
 *   `undefined` is convenient for the end user and it is very common that
 *   wherever `undefined` is valid so is `null`. For some examples it is valid
 *   for `options.prop ??= "default"`, `options.prop ||= "default"`,
 *   `if (options.prop) { ... }`, `if (options.prop == null)`, or so on.
 * - Use `IntentionalPartial` when an explicit `undefined` is problematic but
 *   leaving off the property entirely is fine. This primarily occurs when
 *   patterns like `options = { ...defaultOptions, ...options }`,
 *   `Object.assign({}, defaultOptions, options)`,
 *   `foundry.utils.mergeObject(defaultOptions, options)`, or so on.
 *
 *   Note that {@link foundry.utils.mergeObject | `foundry.utils.mergeObject`}
 *   also expands the object. So once `ExpandsTo` exists you should also use
 *   that helper type.
 *
 *   What these patterns have in common is that if `options` looks like
 *   `{ prop: undefined }` that will override whatever is in `defaultOptions`
 *   and may cause issues. Note that even if you see one of these patterns you
 *   also need to ensure that `undefined` would cause issues down the road
 *   before using `IntentionalPartial` as it could be an intended way of
 *   resetting a property.
 * - Use `InexactPartial` when `null` is problematic but `undefined` is not.
 *   The most common time this shows up is with the pattern
 *   `exampleFunction({ prop = "foo" } = {}) { ... }`.

/**
 * Converts a regular function type into a function derived from a method.
 *
 * Methods have a special exception in TypeScript that allows unsound subtyping
 * that unfortunately has been deeply engrained into not just JavaScript codebases
 * but the core APIs of JavaScript itself in the DOM.
 *
 * It might seem odd to want to opt-in to this unsoundness but it's unfortunately
 * useful in several cases, such as when you have a property like
 * `prop: ((arg: Options) => number) | undefined` and you want to meet the expectations
 * from other similar methods.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * declare class ExampleBaseClass {
 *     // This demonstrates a typical example of where the allowed unsoundness is useful.
 *     methodOne(arg: { x: string }): number;
 *
 *     // This helps demonstrates an example that may be easier to recognize as unsound.
 *     methodTwo(arg: string): number;
 *
 *     functionProperty: (arg: string) => number;
 *     methodLikeProperty: ToMethod<(arg: string) => number>;
 * }
 *
 * // TypeScript allows this without any errors.
 * declare class MethodSubclassing extends ExampleBaseClass {
 *     // It's a very common thing for subclasses to ask for extra arguments.
 *     methodOne(arg: { x: string; y: string }): number;
 *
 *     // Only taking `"foo" | "bar"` should seem pretty unsound.
 *     // The above is actually equally unsound but it's less obvious to many people.
 *     methodTwo(arg: "foo" | "bar"): number;
 * }
 *
 * const exampleMethodSubclass: ExampleBaseClass = new MethodSubclassing();
 *
 * // This is allowed, however at runtime `MethodSubclassing#methodOne` could
 * // will almost certainly error as it has the required property `y`.
 * // The reason why there's no errors is an intentional unsoundness in TypeScript.
 * exampleMethodSubclass.methodOne({ x: "foo" });
 *
 * // Similarly this is allowed.
 * // Both methods show taking arguments that are 'subtypes' of the original.
 * // In the case of functions this is unsound as demonstrated because in both
 * // examples you're substituting a function that has to be able to be called
 * // with a wide variety of arguments with one that will error for many of them.
 * exampleMethodSubclass.methodTwo("lorem");
 *
 * declare class PropertySubclassing extends ExampleBaseClass {
 *     // This errors right here. This preventative error is because of the prior
 *     // explained unsoundness. It errors here because there's really only 3
 *     // places to error at compile time to prevent a runtime error:
 *     // 1. At the call site when a subclass is used unsoundly. Unfortunately
 *     //    at this point it's too late to know for certain if it's a subclass
 *     //    or not. For example there could be a guarded condition to avoid
 *     //    subclasses that TypeScript can't possibly track.
 *     // 2. When trying to assign `PropertySubclassing` to `ExampleBaseClass`.
 *     //    This would be a feasible alternative but would likely come as a
 *     //    surprise as the subclass could have been used for quite a while
 *     //    before trying to be assigned to its superclass.
 *     // 3. Error at the definition. This is where TypeScript has chosen to error.
 *     //    The error is unfortunately not the most intuitive but it is correct.
 *     functionProperty: (arg: "foo" | "bar") => number;
 * }
 *
 * declare class MethodLikeSubclassing {
 *     // This is unsound but by using the `ToMethod` in the parent class it's allowed.
 *     methodLikeProperty: (arg: "foo" | "bar") => number;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The TypeScript FAQ explains this in a way that may either be intuitive and
 * explain all lingering questions or be confusing and muddle the waters.
 * It's also worth mentioning that it claims all function parameters work this way,
 * this behavior is disabled for functions in most codebases (including this one)
 * because of the `strictFunctionTypes` compiler flag, implicit under `strict: true`.
 * See: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#why-are-function-parameters-bivariant
