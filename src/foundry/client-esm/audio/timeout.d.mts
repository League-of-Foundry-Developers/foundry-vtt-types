/**
 * A framework for scheduled audio events with more precise and synchronized timing than using window.setTimeout.
 * This approach creates an empty audio buffer of the desired duration played using the shared game audio context.
 * The onended event of the AudioBufferSourceNode provides a very precise way to synchronize audio events.
 * For audio timing, this is preferable because it avoids numerous issues with window.setTimeout.
 *
 * @example Using a callback function
 * ```js
 * function playForDuration(sound, duration) {
 *   sound.play();
 *   const wait = new AudioTimeout(duration, {callback: () => sound.stop()})
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Using an awaited Promise
 * ```js
 * async function playForDuration(sound, duration) {
 *   sound.play();
 *   const timeout = new AudioTimeout(delay);
 *   await timeout.complete;
 *   sound.stop();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Using the wait helper
 * ```js
 * async function playForDuration(sound, duration) {
 *   sound.play();
 *   await AudioTimeout.wait(duration);
 *   sound.stop();
 * }
 * ```
