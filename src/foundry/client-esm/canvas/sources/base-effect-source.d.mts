 * @example A standard PointSource lifecycle:
 * ```js
 * const source = new PointSource({object}); // Create the point source
 * source.initialize(data);                  // Configure the point source with new data
 * source.refresh();                         // Refresh the point source
 * source.destroy();                         // Destroy the point source
 * ```
