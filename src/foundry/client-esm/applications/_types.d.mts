// Well this is the file in which Foundry defines these types. We don't house
// them here because it has poor discoverability. The names Foundry has chosen
// also overlaps with other existing names. For example `ApplicationConfiguration`
// is also a class in `src/foundry/common/config.d.mts`. It's also just nice to
// have as reference to keep us synced with the latest version of Foundry.
