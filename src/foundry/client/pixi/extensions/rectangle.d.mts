/**
 * Typically in a mapped type TypeScript associates your type to the original.
 * This means you keep modifiers (`readonly` and `?`), go to definition takes you
 * to the original type not the mapped type, and comments are inherited.
 *
 * This utility type disables all of that by effectively tricking TypeScript into
 * not associating them anymore. Writing `{ [_ in string as K]: ... }` is the primary
 * trick used in this type.
 *
 * The reason why this type is so verbose though is because it's trying to preserve
 * modifiers which means it has to check for all 4 possibilities:
 * - mutable and optional
 * - mutable and required
 * - readonly and optional
 * - readonly and required
