/**
 * The Sight Layer which implements dynamic vision, lighting, and fog of war
 * This layer uses an event-driven workflow to perform the minimal required calculation in response to changes.
 * @see PointSource
 *
 * The container structure of this layer is as follows:
 *
 * unexplored   The unexplored background which spans the entire canvas
 * explored     The exploration container which tracks exploration progress
 * revealed       A container of regions which have previously been revealed
 * saved          The saved fog exploration texture
 * pending        Pending exploration which has not yet been committed to the texture
 * vision         The container of current vision exploration
 * vision.base      Baseline provided vision
 * vision.fov       Current light source field-of-view polygons
 * vision.los       Current vision source line-of-sight polygons
 * vision.roofs     Roof textures which should temporarily be revealed
 *
 * @example <caption>The sightRefresh hook</caption>
 * ```typescript
 * Hooks.on("sightRefresh", layer => {});
