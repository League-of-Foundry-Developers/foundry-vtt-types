   * This namespace contains typescript specific type definitions for the {@link Hooks} callback functions. It contains an
   * interface ({@link Hooks.StaticCallbacks}) for callbacks with static names. There are more function types in the
   * namespace for the dynamic hooks, whose names are generated at runtime. There is also a union of all of the dynamic
   * hooks ({@link Hooks.DynamicCallbacks}).
   *
   * Callback types remarked to be called with {@link Hooks.callAll} do not care about the return value of the callback.
   * Callback types remarked to be called with {@link Hooks.call} do care about the return value and will stop executing
   * remaining callbacks if `false` is returned. If a callback type does not have such a remark, pay attention to the
   * return value documentation.
   *
   * @example Using a callback type with a static name
   * ```typescript
   * Hooks.on("updateWorldTime", (worldTime, dt) => {
   *   worldTime; // number
   *   dt; // number
   *   // [...]
   * })
   * ```
   *
   * @example Using a callback with a dynamic name and generic parameter
   * ```typescript
   * Hooks.on<Hooks.CloseApplication<FormApplication>>("closeFormApplication", (app, jq) => {
   *   app; // FormApplication
   *   jq; // JQuery
   *   // [...]
   * })
   * ```
   *
   * @example Using the `error` callback type
   * ```typescript
   * Hooks.on("error", (...args) => {
   *   if (args[0] === "Canvas#draw")
   *     args[2].layer // CanvasLayer
   *   // [...]
